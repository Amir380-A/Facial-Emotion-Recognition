# Introduction 

We trained a CNN model and a bunch of Pre-trained models to classify Facial Emotion Expressions.
We used  6 different models like CNN, VGG-16, ResNet50V2, EfficientNetV2B0, EfficientNetB0, and VGG-19 on 7 classes: happy, fear, disgust, sad, angry, neutral, and surprise for the purpose of comparing the accuracy of different models and experiment with different pre-trained models and how to tune it for our specific classification task.
That was for a college Project.



## Dataset

 we got our dataset from Kaggle: Face expression recognition dataset, link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset.
